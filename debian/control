Description: adaptive sampling for experiments with well-ordered items
 This program can be used to optimize the sampling (measurement)
 process with respect to a given utility-measure. Example measures are
 for instance the expected gain in Shannon information or reduction in
 variance. All computations are based on the Bayesian binning library,
 which is an inference algorithm for data from a set of multinomial
 distributions that are related through a well-ordering (for instance
 space or time). Nearby data points are binned together if the
 parameters of the underlying distributions are inferred to be
 equal. This allows one to increase statistical strength and thereby gives
 a better estimate of the underlying multinomial parameters.
 .
 The package includes several examples for sampling psychometric
 functions.
