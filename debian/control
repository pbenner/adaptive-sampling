Description: adaptive placement of measurments in experiments with ordered items
 This program can be used to optimize the measurement process in
 experiments with respect to a given utility-measure. Example measures
 are for instance the expected gain in Shannon information or
 reduction in variance. All computations are based on the Bayesian
 binning library, which is an inference algorithm for multinomial data
 where the independent variables are ordered (for instance time). The
 method allows sharing of statistical strength and thereby increases
 the certainty of posterior estimates.
 .
 The package includes several examples for measuring psychometric
 functions.

Description: library providing a Bayesian binning algorithm for ordered data
 The Bayesian binning library is an inference algorithm for data from
 a set of multinomial distributions where the independent variables
 are ordered (for instance time). Nearby data points are binned
 together if the parameters of the underlying distributions are
 inferred to be equal, which is called sharing of statistical
 strength. The library can be used for adaptive sampling or pure data
 analysis. One application if for instance the analysis of spike trains.
